    <h2>why i choose this topic ?</h2>
    <p>It took me almost two years to finally start my YouTube journey. I’ve always wanted to do something like this, but I didn’t 
        start filming videos until I 
        moved to the U.S. YouTube is such a huge platform, and for a long time, 
        I didn’t have the courage to upload anything.</p>

    <p>But two months ago, something changed. I realized how short life really is, and how much time we waste by caring 
    too much about what others might think. That thought really hit me deep, and I finally decided to take the first step.</p>

     <p>There’s still a long way to go, of course but I believe the hardest part is starting. 
        I knew nothing when I started this class, and now we’re already working on the final project. That’s a big deal to me!</p>

        <p>I haven’t made any money from YouTube yet, but for this project, I did my best to research how it works and
            I’ll share what I’ve learned with you here.</p>
