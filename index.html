        <h1> Who Am I ? </h1>
        <p> <p>I was born in 2000 in Bursa, Turkey the city of cats! 
            I have always been passionate about learning, exploring new things, 
            and expressing myself through art. I took swimming lessons for 7 years, and 
            it became a big part of my life. However, as I started spending too much time 
            focusing on swimming, I began neglecting my studies. My father was not happy with
            this situation, and I made the difficult decision to quit
            swimming to prioritize my education.
            My younger sibling was born 
            one of the most meaningful and powerful bonds I have ever experienced in life. 
            Becoming an older sister gave me a new sense of responsibility and joy.Later, I was accepted into a 
            Civil Engineering after passing the university entrance exam, and I studied Civil Engineering 
            for 3.5 years. It was a challenging but valuable experience that helped shape my discipline and 
            problem-solving skills.
            I am currently an honors student at 
            Johnson County Community College, pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems, 
            and continuously growing both technically and personally every day.</p>
            </p>

             new things and expressing myself through art.
