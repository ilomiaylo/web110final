        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>In this portfolio, I wanted to share my YouTube videos. Since I am still a student,
             I dont yet have completed projects in the field of Computer Science. That is why I chose to highlight the 
             creative work I have done so far through my videos. So far, I have created and published three YouTube videos, 
            each of which reflects a different side of my interests and creativity.</p>

                <p>This was my very first YouTube video, recorded during my last week before school started in the U.S. I introduced myself and shared a little bit about my personality and interests. It was the beginning of my content creation journey.</p>
